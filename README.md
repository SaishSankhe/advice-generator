## Overview

Build out a advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

I have also added the capability to copy the advice to clipboard.

### What I learned

This is the first time I have used Next.js for a project. It was great fun to learn something new and implement the challenge. I got to learn different ways of content rendering like Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation. I also learned how to create a link preview for social media link sharing and now this website has a working link preview as well.

### Continued development

I am planning to add a sharing option where a user can click on share and the image of current advice will be available for sharing.
